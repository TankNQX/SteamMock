:: Run code review cleanly relying on the stored wizard credentials
::
:: Making the report readable on GitHub takes two independent fixes:
::
::   1. The file has to be UTF-8, not UTF-16LE. Tee-Object -FilePath writes
::      UTF-16LE under Windows PowerShell, which GitHub cannot decode, so the
::      output goes through a StreamWriter with UTF8Encoding(false) instead.
::      The live console echo is kept.
::
::   2. The child output has to be decoded as UTF-8. PowerShell reads a native
::      command's stdout using [Console]::OutputEncoding, which is the OEM code
::      page when this runs from an ordinary console. ocr writes UTF-8, so
::      without this the report is mojibake: a box-drawing character shows up as
::      the three letters "O-tilde o-diaeresis C-cedilla". Setting it before ocr
::      runs fixes both the written file and what the console echo shows.
